Release 4.0 Alpha 1
-------------------

HttpClient 4.0 represents a complete, ground-up redesign and almost a complete
rewrite of the HttpClient 3.x codeline. This release finally addresses several
design flaws that existed since the 1.0 release and could not be fixed without
a major code overhaul and breaking API compatibility.

The HttpClient 4.0 API is still very experimental and is bound to change
during the course of the ALPHA development phase. Several important features
have not yet been ported to the new API.

Architectural changes
---------------------

* Redesign of the HttpClient internals addressing all known
  major architectural shortcomings of the 3.x codeline

* Cleaner, more flexible and expressive API   

* Better performance and smaller memory footprint due to a more 
  efficient HTTP transport based on HttpCore. HttpClient 4.0 is 
  expected to be 10% to 25% faster than HttpClient 3.x codeline

* More modular structure   

* Pluggable redirect and authentication handlers   

* Support for protocol incerceptors

* Improved connection management 

* Improved support for sending requests via a proxy or a chain of 
  proxies 

* Improved handling redirects of entity enclosing requests

* More flexible SSL context customization 

* Reduced intermediate garbage in the process of
  generating HTTP requests and parsing HTTP responses 

-------------------

HttpClient 3.x features that have NOT yet been ported
-------------------
* NTLM authentication scheme

* RFC2965 cookie policy (Cookie2)

* Support for multipart MIME coded entities  

-------------------
The following is a list of contributions tracked in JIRA.
Note that this is not a complete list of contributions or changes.
Since the API was redesigned completely, tracking everything outside
of the source code repository would have been too burdensome.
